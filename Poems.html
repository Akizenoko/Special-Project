        <p id = poem1title> 1st Poem </p>
        <p id = poem1> There we are on a gacha game
            Where everything started, we're friendship we claim
            Hunting treasures, solving puzzles on fontaine soil
            Releaving stress releasing turmoil
            <br>
            <br>
            Goofing around, having fun
            At the end of the day, I realized
            In Searching for treasure, I found you instead
            Not knowing the journey we experience ahead
            <br>
            <br>
            Discord, a simple app but an app we treasure sharing everything, to flexing upto embarrassing moments. 
            Giving goofy and funny comments
            Privacy, we cherish the most
            but broke down when we shared our posts,
            To screenshot messages to personal moments
            We truly breaking the rule of provacy
            <br>
            <br>
            The moment my eyes darted to your face, 
            A face full of innocence and love, short haired, white skin, a beautiful sight, a worthy trade of exchanging our face. 
            <br>
            <br>
            In happier times, there are dark times, quarreling at a simple thing as abandonment
            Hurting feelings, breaking hearts, as we both, lost and adrift in the sea of regrets. 
            I am sorry, I am so sorry, words uttered in my mouth, seeing you hurting, hurted me the most that I didn't even expect. 
            Panicked! As I heard "I am leaving" 
            I won't let you, I won't let you
            Repeated in my mind as I did everything. 
            <br>
            <br>
            After the Storm comes the breeze
            A gentle hush from the both of us, 
            pinky promises seals the deal
            Strengthening relationship more than ever. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Our journey continues, through genshin, 
            through discord, laughing and crying,
            To teasing and rizzing 
            Nothing can set us apart
            Sharing music, we never knew we liked
            Relating to lyrics, vibing and chilling,
            adventuring into you favorites and Encountering problems where we could just escape. Only the two of us.. Alone in an isolating.. Peaceful space.
            As We reached at an uncertain... As to
            "what are we?"
            <br> 
            <br>
            ...... A question that haunts us...... 
            "what are we truly?" 
            Clouded minds
            "i don't know" 
            "I dont know either" 
            <br>
            <br>
            Ice cream, what a funny word
            Ice cream.... Something that would become dear to me
            Ice cream, something I must resist
            And at the same time I crave for maybe.. Maybe I have fallen for you... Fallen deeply so we can say
            I do, to the 27th of February, 2031</p>
            
            <p id = poem2title> 2nd Poem </p>
            <p id = poem2>
                As the slumber takes you in
                I am all alone in my world again
                Time passes by so slow
                Without you by my side, witnessing your glow
                <br>
                <br>
                Love is such a wonderful thing
                Only for you, I felt this kind of feeling 
                your presence alone feels like the world is healing
                Wishing to take your hand and put this lovely ring
                <br>
                <br>

                When we are apart, my world is somber
                On a world without you, my heart feels tighter
                But greeted with your lovely "HIII mahal"
                Happiness is here, guaranteed to befall
                <br>
                <br>

                Oh how beautiful those lovely eyes
                As your gaze eliminates, my silent cries
                How you gaze upon me, makes my heart flutter
                The way your eyes twinkle makes everything better
                <br>
                <br>
                
                You dissappearing is my biggest destruction 
                In fear of losing you, leaving is not an option
                Even if the world may turn against us
                I am always here with you, 
                forever loving you
                <br>
                <br>

                We may have bad days and bad times
                Hurting us left and right, tearing our heart
                I will hold on to it, adapt and overcome 
                Fighting the battle with your side
                As nothing can make us divide
                <br>
                <br>

                We fit like a Lego, clicking quickly
                hard to separate even time goes endlessly
                Our goofy silly antics, describe ourselves
                The type of love story, our kids we tell
                Even as centuries pass, as we grow old
                Our story is worth remembering, a memory of gold
                <br>
                <br>

                So as we meet in a different lifetime, 
                in a different universe, we shall find 
                No matter what You, me and each other
                Lets love again, now and forever.</p>

            <p id = poem3title> 3rd Poem </p>
            <p id = poem3> My Yeoubi, My Sweet Esther 
                My love for you, Never Falter
                For it rises and rises
                Forever shining endless
                <br>
                <br>

                You are my light, my star
                Healing my pain and scar
                Enless, Boundless, limitless
                The love i feel, I can't express
                <br>
                <br>

                A simple life with you is all I wish
                Doing taxes, cooking your favorite dish
                Life isn't so bad after all
                As we dance together in the music hall
                <br>
                <br>

                So let's hold onto this love, we cherish
                Binding our hearts with promise 
                Pushing through hardships 
                Together, our love will flourish

        <p id = herpoem1title> 1st Poem </p>
        <p id = herpoem1>the doorways weep beneath our tread
                <br>
                <br>

                your whisper stains the falling rain the clocks unwind inside my head and every path forgets its name
                <br>
                <br>

                the mirrors flood with breathing stone your shadow peels across my chest the rooms collapse until we're bone then 
                build again without our rest
                <br>
                <br>         

                we kiss where all the seasons rot we sleep inside the seams of air and whether dream or not or not i find you waiting everywhere</p>

        <p id = herpoem2title> 2nd Poem </p>
        <p id = herpoem2> in every life through every dawn, i find you waiting, never gone, through shadows long and winds that      scream, we walk the path of endless dream.
            <br>
            <br>

            you call me wifey in this time, but in the next, i'll be your rhyme, your yeoubi, your sweet esther true, i'll always find my way to you.
            <br>
            <br>

            when stars forget to light the night, we'll carve our names with fire and light, my dummy, honey, every word becomes the song we've always heard.
            <br>
            <br>

            you are my flame, my guiding spark, you light my way when all is dark, my dojin, my mayalu, my core, in every life, i love you more.
            <br>
            <br>
            i'd cross the seas, i'd walk through flame, to bring you back, to call your name, and when the world begins to fall, our love will rise, it conquers all.
            <br>
            <br>
            so let them tear the sky in two, they cannot break the bond we knew, forever is a truth we are, imprinted deep, no matter far.
            <br>
            <br>
            i'm yours in soul, in heart, in mind, in every form, in space and time, our love is more than life, than breath, it lives beyond both life and death
            </p>
        <p id= herpoem3title> 3rd Poem </p>
        <p id = herpoem3> your absence unstitched the clock time spills sideways, dripping from the ceiling like a forgotten prayer
            <br>
            <br>

            i write letters to the shape you left in the air, but the ink evaporates mid-sentence
            <br>
            <br>

            i search for you in rooms that vanish when i open the door, in mirrors that reflect only the ache
            <br>
            <br>

            you were the axis of my quiet delirium-and now the world turns without axis, a broken toy in god's attic
            <br>
            <br>

            still, i wait-not for return, but for the chance to be ruined by your love again 
            </p>
        <p id= herpoem4title> 4th Poem </p>
        <p id = herpoem4> in the quiet of a sleepless night, your name is the only thing that feels right.
            <br>
            <br>

        it echoes soft, like a whispered prayer, a promise that you'll always be there.
        <br>
        <br>

        your touch is the sun after rain, a balm that heals the deepest pain. when you smile, the world stands still, and in your eyes, time bends to your will.
        <br>
        <br>

        love with you is like a song, sweet and endless, where we belong. your laugh, a melody in the air, fills the silence with something rare.
        <br>
        <br>

        when we're apart, my heart is torn, like a flower longing to be reborn. but with you near, my soul takes flight, for you are the reason my world feels right.
        <br>
        <br>

        so let me stay in this dream we weave, where love is a place we both believe. for in your arms, i find my home, in this love, i am never alone.</p>
        <p id= herpoem5title> 5th Poem </p>
        <p id = herpoem5> to my dojin, my maya, my everything
        <br>
        <br>

        i loved you long before the dawn, before the night had slipped and gone, before the world had learned my name, i loved you wild, i loved you tame
        <br>
        <br>
        you are the flame inside the cold, the only truth i dare to hold, a whisper deep within my chest, the ache that never comes to rest
        <br>
        <br>
        you are the dream i cannot flee, the lock, the chain, and yet the key, the maze i wander just to find the place where your soul touches mine
        <br>
        <br>
        my dojin, maya, in your eyes i see the stars, i see the skies, and if this world should fall apart, i'd still belong to you, heart by heart </p>
